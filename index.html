    <p> My name is Kelsey Swasey and I am a New York based photographer.
        Two years ago, photography became a passion of mine.
        I love the idea of walking around any corner, park, and place in New York City and capturing images behind the camera.
        Photography is a way to hold memories and cherish them. The vibrant colors in a photograph is one step to an aesthetic
        mindset. In the future, I hope to experience new adventures and illustrate more extravagant photos.
